## Usage

### Individual Engine Usage
```python
from Engines.core_engine import CoreEngine, EngineConfig
from Engines.risk_engine import RiskEngine, RiskEngineConfig
from Engines.statistical_engine import StatisticalEngine, StatisticalEngineConfig
from Engines.validation_engine import ValidationEngine, ValidationEngineConfig

# Run individual engine
config = EngineConfig()
engine = CoreEngine(config)
engine.run()
```

### Pipeline Usage
```python
from Engines.pipeline_engine import PipelineEngine, PipelineEngineConfig

config = PipelineEngineConfig()
engine = PipelineEngine(config)
engine.run()
```

### Validation Engine Usage
```python
from Engines.validation_engine import ValidationEngine, ValidationEngineConfig

config = ValidationEngineConfig()
engine = ValidationEngine(config)
engine.run()
```

## Configuration

Each engine has its own configuration class with specialized parameters. See individual engine files for detailed configuration options.

## Results

Results are saved to the `Results/` directory with timestamps and organized by engine type.

## Old Engines

Previous versions of engines have been moved to `storage/engines_storage/` for reference.
