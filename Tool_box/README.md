# Tool Box

Curated utilities for analysis, aggregation, parsing, reporting, and operational workflows.

Structure:

- aggregators/: Scripts that aggregate results and rank strategies/pairs
- parsers/: Loaders/parsers for results and market data
- analysis/: Deeper analytical utilities and diagnostics
- segmentation/: Tools to segment and validate market regimes/periods
- operations/: Utilities to sort/move/organize outputs
- utils/: Shared helpers (e.g., risk management utilities)
- reports/: Report generators, templates, and static assets (outputs are saved under Backtesting/results)

Note: Legacy scripts remain under `analysis/` for backward compatibility. New work should live in the folders above.
